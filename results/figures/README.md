## Folder structure for figures

The folders including the word 'full' in their names, contain the figures
of all results (all performance measures/estimands, across all scenarios).
In these folders, the supplementary figures can be found as well, where figures
S1 - S6 can be found within `full estimands` and S7-S10 within `full performance measures`.
The other folders containing the word 'thesis', indicate that the plots used within the thesis can
be found here.

In general, the figures with 'pred_sel' depict the results
with predictor selection, and 'no_pred_sel' depict those without predictor selection.
