## Folder structure for figures

The folders including the word 'full' in their names, contain the figures
of all results (all performance measures/estimands, across all scenarios). Those
containing the word 'thesis' indicate that the plots used within the thesis can
be found here.

In general, those figures with 'pred_sel' indicate whether it depicts the results
with or without predictor selection used as specified for each scenario.
